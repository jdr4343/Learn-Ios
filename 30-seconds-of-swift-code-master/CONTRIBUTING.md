Pull request guidelines
- Modify the README directly as well as `30secsofswiftcode.playground/Contents.swift`.
- Snippets should be short (usually under 10 lines.) Still submit your snippet if it is under that and we will review it or help you shorten it or improve it.
- Include examples, which are sort-of like *test cases*.
- Your snippets should have a unique name, unlike any that are already in the list.
- Snippet descriptions should be short, succinct, and to-the-point.
